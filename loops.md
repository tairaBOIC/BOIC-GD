# Loops and Looping

Loops simply repeat themselves for a certain amount of time or conditions.

<br><br><br><br><br>

The easiest Loop is a `while` loop.
```csharp
while(health > 0){
  health -= 1;
}

```
This will take 1 health away until it reaches 0

<br><br><br><br><br>

The next loop is a `for` loop

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i > 0; i++){
  health -= 1;
}
```

It is slightly more complex so lets break it down

```csharp
for (int )
